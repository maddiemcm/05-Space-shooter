Project: 05 SPACE SHOOTER
Peer's repository: https://github.com/maddiemcm/05-Space-shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
- I learned about time penalties. I haven't seen that used before. I feel like I was aware of it, but had never seen it in practice.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
- I love the attention to detail, the way they took advantage of the assets, and the movement of the "enemies." I would like to try to include more movement to my own projects to give it a more realistic feel.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
- This isn't a problem in and of itself, but perhaps just a preference. I think the game would have been a little more enjoyable if the player speed was a little higher. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
- I think that the levels could have been clearer. I looked through the whole code before I understood the purpose. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
- The donut levels were somewhat confusing to me. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
-Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
-If someone tries playing the game before reading the code, or if they didn't understand code, they might have trouble knowing what the controls are. I would recommend describing the controls!
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
-I was blown away by the effort put into the design! You're going to make a fantastic game designer!
