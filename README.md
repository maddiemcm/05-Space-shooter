# 05-Space-shooter

This program runs through python arcade and has the player play as an alien sprite, attacking the possessed magical floating donuts with bullets that eventually kill the donuts. The game runs on three levels, once the first level is done, the second levels immediately starts with faster donuts that are more randon in their movement patterns. The score will add up until the third round where the boss appears and shoots back at you. If you can kill the boss before it kills you then you win. If not, you lose. 

The sprites used are from a mixture of https://kenney.nl and https://opengameart.org

I created the final boss using a website called piksel.
