# 05-Space-shooter

This program runs through python arcade and has the player play as an alien sprite, attacking the possessed magical floating donuts with bullets that eventually kill the donuts. The game runs on three levels, once the first level is done, the second levels immediately starts with faster donuts that are more random in their movement patterns. The score will add up as you defeat each level until the final round where the three bosses appear. The bosses have the ability to fire back and they don't die on impact so watch out!  

The sprites used are from a mixture of https://kenney.nl and https://opengameart.org

I created the final boss using a website called pikselapp

Have fun!
